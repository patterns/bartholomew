# This is the preamble, and it is written in TOML format.
# In this section, you set information about the page, like title, description, and the template
# that should be used to render the content.

# REQUIRED

# The title of the document
title = "Pink Elephants on Parade"

# OPTIONAL

# The description of the page.
description = "L'essai sur site statique et Mastodon l√©ger."

# The name of the template to use. `templates/` is automatically prepended, and `.hbs` is appended.
# So if you set this to `blog`, it becomes `templates/blog.hbs`.
template = "hero"

# These fields are user-definable. You can create whatever values you want
# here. The format must be `string` keys with `string` values, though.
